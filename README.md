- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jairo Ribeiro, a Senior Embedded Engineer at Volkswagen Group Services. Iâ€™m currently studying for a BTech in Software Analysis and Development at Uninter Europe in Lisbon, Portugal.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m passionate about expanding my skills and experience, particularly in backend development. I have a keen interest in modern languages and frameworks for both web and mobile development.
- :books: Currently, Iâ€™m focusing on mastering Spring Boot, Javascript/Typescript, Design Patterns, Domain-Driven Design (DDD), and Clean Architecture. Additionally, Iâ€™m learning Rust, which has been particularly challenging due to its unique features like Ownership, Borrowing, and a strong emphasis on immutabilityâ€”concepts that set it apart from other languages.
- :computer: Iâ€™m eager to collaborate on backend projects, especially those utilizing Spring Boot, JavaScript or TypeScript.
